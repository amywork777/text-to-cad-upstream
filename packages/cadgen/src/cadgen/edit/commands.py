"""Edit mode's modeling commands: a CAD command written as one line of the part's script.

Fillet, Chamfer, Hole, Shell, Mirror and Pattern act on what the engineer selects: faces and edges
picked on the model (cadgen's selectors, ``f12`` and ``e3``, each with the geometry the viewer read
for it) and a feature picked in the history. A command writes one line of build123d into the
script, after the statement that makes the part's body, and the tracer reads it back as a feature
of its own.

The hard part is the selection. A face or an edge is matched to the part as its script makes it
now by its geometry (its kind, centre, and length or area), then written as build123d's own
selectors, which say where it is rather than what number it has: ``tray.edges().group_by(
bd.Axis.Z)[-1]`` (the top edges), ``tray.faces().sort_by(bd.Axis.Z)[-1].outer_wire().edges()``
(the top face's outer edges). The cheapest chain of selectors that picks exactly the selection is
found by a search over what build123d's selectors read of each face and edge, read once with
build123d's own code, and the chain is run before it is written.

Runs in the tracer's process only: it imports build123d.
