    identity (dev+inode), non-blocking acquire raising the CONTENTION errno when another
    handle holds the region -- the exact contract the Windows backend relies on.

    That errno used to be EACCES here, and EACCES is what made this fake useless for the one
    thing it exists to catch. The real ``_locking`` reports contention as EDEADLOCK, which was
    missing from the backend's busy set, so on Windows the loser of a race fell through to the
    degradation branch and ran with no lock at all. Every test passed, because the fake was
    faithful to everything except the errno that decides which branch is taken.

    It is likewise faithful about HANDLE MODE, because that decided a second real bug: the
    CRT refuses to take a region lock through a READ-ONLY descriptor (EBADF), and ``probe``
    used to open the mutex ``rb``, so every real Windows probe failed EBADF -- not a
    contention errno -- and reported a writer-held mutex as degraded-idle. The fake checks
    each fd's access mode and raises EBADF for read-only handles, so a probe that regresses
    to a read-only open fails here instead of only on Windows."""
